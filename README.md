### Dice 
A 3D Dice, when clicked gives a random output.
To check it out, you must have python installed (or anything else to setup a local host environment). 
Once you have it installed, cd into the project and setup a localhost environment with the following command :
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
Open your browser and type in 'localhost:8000'.
